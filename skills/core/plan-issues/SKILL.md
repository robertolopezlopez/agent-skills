# Plan Issues

Use this skill for planning and decomposition work.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- break a scoped change into actionable work items
- decompose a plan into vertical slices
- identify dependencies and blockers between work items
- prepare work for humans or agents
- turn an understood change into an execution-ready breakdown

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when:

- the main task is broad investigation or root-cause analysis; use `repository-technical-analysis`
- the main task is debugging or reproducing a concrete failure; use `diagnose`
- the main task is implementation through a test-first loop; use `tdd`
- the main task is only transport access to GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Confluence, or CircleCI
- the change is still too vague to decompose confidently
- a repository-specific overlay already fully defines the planning workflow

## Inputs

Accept any of:

- a scoped task or change request
- a local planning artifact
- a GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Confluence, or CircleCI item whose scope is already clear
- a feature, fix, or refactor description with enough detail to split into work items
- an already-approved plan that needs execution slicing

## First Read

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `Makefile`, and repo-specific contributor docs when present.
- If a local artifact exists for the task (prefer `$ARTIFACTS/<meaningful_id>/` paths per repo `ARTIFACTS.md`; legacy root-level files remain valid), read it first.
- Reuse `repository-technical-analysis` first if the problem or scope is still unclear.
- Reuse transport skills first if the plan depends on remote issue, MR, or CI run context that has not yet been fetched.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the scope of the change.
2. Refuse to decompose until the goal is clear enough to split confidently.
3. Identify the smallest useful vertical slices.
4. Prefer slices that cut through the necessary layers end-to-end rather than grouping work by technical layer.
5. Write each slice as one or two concise action sentences. Example: `Extract
   the existing test data into reusable fixtures, then add focused tests for the
   affected behavior. Keep the change limited to test organization and coverage.`
   Add dependencies, blockers, or validation only when non-obvious or required.
6. Review the breakdown for:
   - unnecessary coupling
   - overly large slices
   - hidden blockers
   - missing validation expectations
7. Produce the ordered work plan.
8. Suggest a follow-on skill only when the user needs it to execute the plan.

## Planning Rules

- Prefer vertical slices over horizontal slices.
- Prefer many thin executable slices over a few large ambiguous ones.
- Keep dependencies explicit.
- Mark human-needed decisions only when they block execution.
- Do not invent precision when the scope is still unclear.
- If decomposition reveals missing understanding, stop and recommend clarification before continuing.

## Validation

- Check that each slice is understandable on its own.
- Check that each slice has a clear purpose and a plausible validation path.
- Check that blockers are called out explicitly.
- Keep the final breakdown small enough to execute incrementally.

## Outputs / Artifacts

Return ordered items with one or two concise action sentences each. Add
dependencies, blockers, validation, or a follow-on skill only when material. Do
not restate the request or explain why each slice is separate.

When the work is non-trivial, this skill may also write:

- `$ARTIFACTS/<meaningful_id>/work_plan_<relevant_name>.md` for new plans (see repo `ARTIFACTS.md`; extend existing paths in place)

## Companion Skills

Use this skill as a planning decomposition layer.

Common pairings:

- `repository-technical-analysis` when scope is still unclear
- `multi-spawn-agent` when the breakdown is ready for delegated execution
- `tdd` when individual slices should be implemented test-first
- repository-specific contributor skills for local commands and validation
- transport per **`GITHUB-ACCESS.md`** + `gh`, **`JIRA-ACCESS.md`** + `acli`, or skills such as `gitlab`, `confluence`, or `circleci` when remote context is needed first

## Safety Notes

- Do not force decomposition when the problem is not yet understood.
- Do not mix planning decomposition with transport or implementation logic.
- Do not hide uncertainty inside fake precision.
