# Git Rebase Conflict Resolver

Take an optional target branch input. Default to `origin/main`. Rebase carefully. Merge intent, not markers.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- rebase a branch onto `origin/main` or another target branch
- resolve rebase or merge conflicts carefully
- preserve compatible intent from both sides of a conflict
- validate the rebased branch before finishing

## When Not to Use

Do not use this skill when:

- the task is a non-rebase branch review with no history rewrite
- the user wants destructive reset behavior not tied to conflict-preserving rebase work
- the task is general Git repository context lookup rather than rebase execution

## Input

- Accept an optional target branch.
- If the user provides a target branch, use it.
- If the user does not provide one, use `origin/main`.

## First read

- Read repo guidance from `AGENTS.md`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, or CI config when choosing validation commands.
- Literal codebase search: follow synced **`LITERAL-CODE-SEARCH.md`** (`agent_config.py --literal-search-policy`) when conflict hunks need surrounding context.

## Inspect state first

- Run `git status --short --branch`.
- Detect whether a rebase is already in progress before starting a new one.
- If the worktree is dirty, separate unrelated user changes from rebase work.
- Do not overwrite or discard unrelated local changes.
- Refresh the chosen target branch with `git fetch` before rebasing.
- When rerunning similar rebases, preserve durable learned sections such as `Conflict Pattern Notes`, `Files With Recurring Conflicts`, and `Post-Rebase Validation Lessons` when they still match the current branch and conflict set.

## Literal codebase search (conflict context)

When a conflicted hunk is not self-explanatory — renamed symbols, moved imports, duplicate helpers, signature changes, or both sides touching the same call path — use **host literal search through Shell**, not the agent Grep tool, unless **`fast-grep`** exits **4** or Shell is unavailable.

1. Read **`fast-grep.env`** when set (`agent_config.py --fast-grep-env`); else run **`fast-grep-prefs.sh show`** once.
2. Search with **`fast-grep --literal 'PATTERN' [PATH]`** from **`agent_config.py --literal-search-dir`**, or run **`rg`** directly when it is the preferred/on-PATH tool.
3. Tighten scope: search the conflicted file's directory or package first; widen only when hits are insufficient.
4. Typical conflict probes:
   - symbols, types, or functions appearing in one side of the hunk but not the other
   - import paths changed on the target branch
   - callers of a merged API or shared config key
   - test files referencing the conflicted module
5. On **`fast-grep`** exit **5**, show **OS-appropriate** **`install_cmd`** from **`fast-grep-resolve --missing`** or **`check_skill_prereqs.sh literal-search`** — ask before installing; do not install unless the user asks.
6. On exit **4** only, fall back to the agent Grep tool if the runtime provides it.

Do not walk the tree manually when a host search tier is available. Prefer **`git grep`** inside the repo when faster tools are missing.

## Start or resume

- If no rebase is in progress, run `git rebase <target-branch>`.
- If a rebase is already in progress, inspect the current conflict set and continue from there.
- Do not push unless the user explicitly asks.

## Resolve conflicts by behavior

For each conflicted file:

- Read the conflicted file with markers.
- Inspect Git stages when useful:
  - `:1:path` for merge base
  - `:2:path` for the rebased-onto branch
  - `:3:path` for the local commit being replayed
- During rebase, remember that `ours` is the target branch side and `theirs` is the replayed local commit side.
- Do not take `ours` or `theirs` wholesale unless the conflict is trivial and verified.
- Identify what changed on the target branch.
- Identify what the local commit intended to add or fix.
- When either side renames, moves, or reshapes a symbol, run **literal codebase search** (above) before merging so callers, imports, and tests stay consistent.
- Keep both changes when compatible.
- If both sides changed the same logic, produce a merged version that preserves the newer architecture and the useful behavior from the local branch.
- Use `git show ORIG_HEAD:path` when helpful to understand the branch state before the rebase began.
- Update tests together with code when the conflict changes behavior, call shape, or architecture.

## Continue cleanly

- Stage resolved files and run `git rebase --continue`.
- If Git opens an editor, continue non-interactively when appropriate, for example with `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue`.
- Repeat until the rebase completes.
- Skip a commit only after verifying its intended effect already exists on the target branch.

## Validate the result

Use the repository's real validation flow.

- Read repo guidance from files such as `AGENTS.md`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, or CI config.
- Run lint first when fast.
- Run the formatter if required, then rerun lint.
- Run targeted tests for the modules touched by the conflict.
- Run broader tests if the conflict affected shared infrastructure, schemas, core models, or cross-cutting utilities.
- If validation fails, fix the branch before considering the rebase complete.
- When a validation step proves noisy or low-signal after conflict resolution, record it once in `Post-Rebase Validation Lessons` with the better follow-up command.

## Validation

- Refresh the chosen target branch before rebasing.
- Verify merged conflict resolution behavior from live files and Git stages, not just conflict markers.
- When resolution depended on call-site or import context, confirm findings with **host literal search** (`rg`, `fast-grep`, or documented fallback) rather than guesswork.
- Run relevant lint, format, and test commands before treating the rebase as complete.
- Keep unrelated local changes intact throughout the workflow.

## Report the outcome

State:

- which branch was rebased onto which target branch
- whether the target branch was user-provided or defaulted to `origin/main`
- which files required manual conflict resolution
- how the important conflicts were merged
- which validation commands were run
- whether they passed
- whether the worktree is clean
- whether the branch now diverges from its remote because history was rewritten

## Outputs / Artifacts

This skill should produce:

- a rebased branch state
- a concise outcome report covering conflict resolution and validation

The report should include:

- target branch used
- files with manual conflicts
- important merge decisions
- validation commands run and results
- final worktree state

## Safety rules

- Never use destructive resets unless explicitly requested.
- Never discard unrelated local changes.
- Never claim both sides were preserved without verifying the merged code path.
- Never stop after resolving conflicts without running relevant validation.

## Self-Improving Behavior

When rerunning rebases for the same branch family or recurring conflict area:

- preserve durable learned sections such as `## Conflict Pattern Notes`, `## Files With Recurring Conflicts`, and `## Post-Rebase Validation Lessons` when they still match the current conflict set
- refresh conclusions against the live conflict markers, Git stages, and current validation output before reusing them
- promote repeated confirmed observations into short heuristics, preferably phrased like `when conflict touches X and Y, validate Z first`
- demote, mark stale, or remove heuristics contradicted by newer branch state or validation evidence

## Companion Skills

Common pairings:

- **`LITERAL-CODE-SEARCH.md`** + **`check_skill_prereqs.sh literal-search`** for host `rg` / `fast-grep` readiness
- **`GIT-ACCESS.md`** for repository identity and safe git operations
- repository-specific contributor skills for repo-local validation commands
- **`repository-technical-analysis`** when conflict resolution needs deeper investigation before merging intent

## Safety Notes

- Never use destructive resets unless explicitly requested.
- Never discard unrelated local changes.
- Never claim both sides were preserved without verifying the merged code path.
- Never stop after resolving conflicts without running relevant validation.
