# Prepare Daily Status

Maintain one concise team-status file per local calendar day.

## When to Use

- Prepare or update a standup, daily status, team sync, or EOD report
- Record session outcomes for colleagues

## When Not to Use

- Personal journaling or agent lessons; use `learn-daily`
- Sending a message to Slack or email
- Rewriting historical status without an explicit request

## Inputs

- Status facts from the current session or user-provided text
- Optional date or timezone override; otherwise use local date and time
- Optional explicit output directory, which overrides `.env` configuration

## Configuration

Read `prepare-daily-status.env` from the active runtime config home:

- `$AGENT_CONFIG_HOME/prepare-daily-status.env` when `AGENT_CONFIG_HOME` is set
- `~/.codex/prepare-daily-status.env` under Codex
- `~/.cursor/prepare-daily-status.env` under Cursor

Accept only this setting:

```dotenv
TEAM_STATUS_DIR=$HOME/Documents/team-status/
```

Expand `$HOME` or `~` in the value without executing the file. If the file or
setting is missing, use `$HOME/Documents/team-status/`. An explicit user path
wins over both. Copy `assets/prepare-daily-status.env.example` to the runtime
config home when the user wants a persistent override; never commit the
customized runtime file.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the status directory using this precedence: explicit user path,
   runtime `.env`, default `$HOME/Documents/team-status/`. Resolve local date
   and time, then use `<status-directory>/YYYY-MM-DD.md`; create the directory
   when missing.
2. Read today’s file before editing it.
3. If absent, create this stable scaffold:

   ```markdown
   # Team status — YYYY-MM-DD

   ## YYYY-MM-DD (updates)

   ### Done since last log
   None.

   ### In progress
   None.

   ### In review
   None.

   ### Blocked / risks
   None.

   ### Next
   None.

   ### Needs help / decisions
   None.

   ### Links
   None.
   ```

4. Keep exactly one `## YYYY-MM-DD (updates)` section. If a legacy file uses
   same-day `## HH:MM` sections, merge them into the scaffold and remove
   duplicate empty boilerplate.
5. Merge new facts:
   - Append each new `Done since last log` bullet after existing bullets; never
     insert it at the top. Keep local `HH:MM` at the start:
     `- **11:15** — CLI-1667 hotfix done, finished.`
   - Keep active work under `In progress` and submitted work under `In review`.
   - Update blockers, next steps, decisions, and links only from stated facts.
   - Remove `None.` when adding content; restore it when a subsection becomes
     empty.
   - Avoid duplicate bullets and multiple same-day status sections.
6. Return the consolidated status section for review or sharing.

## Validation

- File date, title, and updates heading use the selected local date.
- All seven subsection names remain exact and appear once.
- No same-day `## HH:MM` sibling sections remain.
- Every logged fact is supported by this session or explicit user input.
- New `Done since last log` bullets appear after existing bullets.

## Outputs / Artifacts

- Updated `<status-directory>/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Consolidated status shown on screen

## Companion Skills

- `learn-daily` only for reusable agent lessons; do not mix those into team
  status.

## Safety Notes

- Never log tokens, passwords, customer secrets, or sensitive internal data.
- Do not delete or rewrite earlier days unless the user explicitly asks.
- If no concrete outcome exists, record `No concrete engineering outcomes
  captured this session` instead of inventing work.
- Ignore unknown `.env` keys and never execute `.env` contents as shell code.
- Request filesystem approval when the runtime cannot write the resolved
  directory.
